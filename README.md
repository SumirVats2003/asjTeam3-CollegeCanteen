College Canteen Application

Problem Statement:

The emergence of technology and the digital era has had an impact on almost every sector and industry. Canteens and cafeterias in schools, universities, and workplaces, on the other hand, have remained loosely unstructured, resulting in significant mismanagement between consumers and canteen workers. 
	People nowadays don't have a lot of time to sit in a cafeteria and wait for someone to take their order. Many customers just come to the canteen for their lunch break or recess, and they barely have enough time to eat their meal before returning to their offices or institutions. As a result, this application allows users to save time and order food anytime they want without having to call the waiter again.


Proposed Solution :

The Project "College Canteen App" is directed to enable the user to log in using the phone authentication, and select, and order the desired food-item from the menu. The application consists of various functionalities including a clean-UI along with the authentication with Firebase on Android using a Phone Number. The application is intended to make the canteen experience hassle-free and smooth, by listing the food items available for a particular day, in "Today's Menu" section. Apart from that, a user would be able to have the food listed in an organised manner.
We believe that, this application, in particular contains a lot of potential in structuring the daily canteen/cafeteria related problems, in a well-organised manner, and both, the customer, and the canteen-staff will have an effortless experience.
